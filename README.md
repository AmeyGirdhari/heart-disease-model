Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

problem defination: the main aim of the project is to find a person is having heart disease or not on several parameters

Data: data is downloaded from ucl repositarory url:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

data dictonary:

evaluation: we are evaluating model beyond accuracy
roc curve and auc
confusion matrix
classification report
precision
f1-score
recall

modelling: this is a classification problem so we are using logistic regression to predict the results
